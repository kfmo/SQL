To select the employee in each department with the highest salary in the US, including employee name, department name, and salary:
        SELECT emp.name, dpt.dept_name, emp.salary
        FROM employee emp, department dpt
        WHERE emp.salary IN (
                              SELECT dept_sk, max(salary)
                              FROM employee
                              GROUP BY dept_sk

            FROM department
           ) USdpt
             on emp.dept_sk = Usdpt.dept_sk;
             
To select the top 5 employees in each department with the highest salaries in the US, including employee names, department names, and salaries:             
        SET @rowNum = 0;

        SELECT emp.name, dpt.dept_name, emp.salary
        FROM

            @rowNum := IF(@salaryMax = max(emp.salary), @rowNum + 1, 1) AS salary,
            @salaryMax := emp.salary
            FROM employee emp, department dpt
            ORDER BY dpt.dept_name, emp.salary DESC, emp.name
           ) topFive

To create a flat table in the database with information from all tables for the department of S&M:             
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS S&MInfo
        SELECT *
        FROM employee emp, level lvl, department dpt, location loc
        WHERE dpt.dept_name = S&M

           AND emp.level_sk = lvl.level_sk
           AND emp.location_sk = loc.location_sk;
           
To pull a list of managers and their direct reports, including IDs and names for both the manager and direct reports:           
        SELECT DISTINCT manager_id, employee_id, name  
        FROM employee
        ORDER BY IFNULL(manager_id), employee_id;

To find the number of employees that started at the company each quarter:
        SELECT QUARTER(start_date) AS quarter of year, COUNT(employee_id) AS number of employees that started

        ORDER BY quarter of year;
        
To find the average tenure of all employees by level (if an employee is still at the company, term_date is null; in that case, today's date is used to calculate tenure):        
        SELECT lvl.level_name AS levelName,
            IF(emp.term_date IS NOT NULL, AVG(DATEDIFF(emp.term_date, emp.start_date)), AVG(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), emp.start_date))) AS avgTenure
        FROM level lvl, employee emp
        WHERE lvl.level_sk = emp.level_sk
        GROUP BY levelName;
